# User Research & Customer Insights - HireFlow

## Primary User Persona

**Name:** Sarah Verma, 32 — Talent Acquisition Manager

### Background
- Works at a 70-person SaaS startup in Bengaluru
- Only HR person handling full-cycle recruiting
- Screens 300-500 resumes per role
- Uses Gmail, Naukri, LinkedIn, Google Drive, and Sheets
- No dedicated ATS or underutilizes basic tools
- Works 50-60 hour weeks including weekends during hiring spikes
- 60% of Indian tech HR roles are women; often first/second HR hire

### Goals
- Quickly shortlist relevant candidates
- Reduce repetitive screening effort
- Improve turnaround time (<48 hours response)
- Be seen as strategic hiring partner, not admin coordinator

### Frustrations
- Endless resume screening (8-12 hours per role)
- Manual scheduling (10-15 emails per interview slot)
- Constant follow-ups and tracking in spreadsheets
- Fear of missing strong candidates buried in volume
- Struggles to defend shortlist decisions with data

### Motivations
- Wants to be more strategic (employer branding, candidate experience)
- Wants confidence in shortlists backed by reasoning
- Wants fast, smooth early funnel that impresses founders

### 🔥 Where is the Friction?

- **High resume volume + low HR bandwidth:** 300-500 resumes per role with zero team support
- **Manual PDF reading = time sink:** Opening, skimming, keyword searching takes 8-12 hours
- **Scheduling is email ping-pong:** 10-15 emails per slot, calendar conflicts, candidate delays
- **Fear of missing strong candidates:** Non-obvious fits get overlooked due to fatigue
- **Workload spikes around hiring cycles:** 3-4 simultaneous roles create unsustainable pressure
- **No data to defend decisions:** Technical hiring managers challenge shortlists; Sarah relies on "gut feel"

### Persona Quote
*"Screening takes my entire day—I barely get time to actually evaluate talent."*

### One-Sentence Summary
Sarah is a Talent Acquisition Manager who needs automation for early screening and scheduling because manual work slows her down, causes burnout, and risks missing great talent.

## Decision Log

| Decision Point | Options Considered | Decision Made | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Primary persona** | Solo TA Manager vs Technical Founder vs Ops Manager | **Solo TA Manager** | Most acute pain, highest expertise, can't delegate, becomes champion |
| **Pain point priority** | Resume overload vs Scheduling chaos vs Missing candidates | **Resume overload (manual screening)** | Highest time consumption, blocks everything downstream, 80% time savings |
| **Success metric focus** | Engagement vs Revenue vs Efficiency | **Efficiency first, then Engagement** | Time-to-Shortlist proves immediate value, WAU validates stickiness |
| **Emotional driver** | Confidence vs Control vs Relief vs Respect | **Relief + Confidence (dual focus)** | Relief drives adoption, confidence drives retention |

### Key Trade-offs

1. **Chose Solo TA Managers over Technical Founders** — Founders have higher budget authority but lower engagement frequency
2. **Prioritized screening over scheduling** — Screening has higher impact (8-12 hrs vs 2-3 hrs saved)
3. **Focused on Tier 1 cities over Tier 2** — Higher hiring volumes, better digital infrastructure, faster AI adoption
4. **Targeted tech/SaaS over all industries** — Higher resume volumes, more comfort with AI tools, better willingness to pay

### Insights That Changed Our Thinking

1. **"Defending decisions to hiring managers" emerged as critical pain** — Explainability isn't just nice-to-have, it's essential
2. **Naukri.com creates unique volume challenge** — 200-400 overnight applications create acute morning overwhelm
3. **WhatsApp is critical for candidate communication** — Email-only solutions feel impersonal in Indian context
4. **Weekend work is normalized but resented** — 60%+ screen resumes on weekends; work-life balance messaging resonates
