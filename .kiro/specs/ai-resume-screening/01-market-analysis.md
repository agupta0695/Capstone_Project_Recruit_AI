## Evidence Gaps & Validation

### Missing Data

- Actual willingness to trust AI for hiring decisions
- Current manual time spent on screening per role
- Integration preferences (standalone vs embedded)
- Price sensitivity threshold for SMBs

### 5 Interview Questions

1. Walk me through your last hiring process — where did you spend the most time?
2. How many resumes do you typically receive per role, and how many do you actually review?
3. What would make you trust an AI to shortlist candidates? What would concern you?
4. If a tool could save you 10 hours per hire, what would you pay monthly?
5. What tools do you currently use for hiring, and what frustrates you most?

### 5-Question Survey

1. Company size? (20-50 / 51-100 / 101-200 employees)
2. Resumes received per role? (<50 / 50-150 / 150-300 / 300+)
3. Hours spent screening per role? (<5 / 5-10 / 10-20 / 20+)
4. Current hiring tools? (None / Job boards only / Basic ATS / Advanced ATS)
5. Would you use AI for resume screening? (Definitely / Probably / Unsure / No)

## Market Summary for PRD

*The Indian HR Tech market for SMBs is estimated at ₹2,400 Cr ($300M) growing at 15-18% CAGR, driven by startup hiring surges and AI adoption.

## Decision Log

| Decision Point | Options Considered | Decision Made | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Market focus** | Global vs Regional vs Local | **Regional (India - Tier 1 cities)** | India's startup ecosystem growing 40%+ YoY with validated HR tech spend; allows focused GTM while maintaining sufficient TAM |
| **Competitor strategy** | Compete directly vs Find whitespace vs Partner | **Find whitespace (SMB-focused AI-first)** | Enterprise players overpriced for SMBs; Indian players lack true AI reasoning |
| **Market timing** | Launch now vs Wait vs Test first | **Test first (90-day validation)** | AI maturity is ready, but need to validate trust in AI hiring decisions |
| **TAM calculation method** | Top-down vs Bottom-up vs Hybrid | **Hybrid** | Top-down for market size validation, bottom-up for achievable targets |

### Key Assumptions Made

1. 10% of target companies will have acute hiring pain
2. Average spend of ₹2-4L/year is achievable based on competitor pricing
3. 75%+ shortlist accuracy is technically feasible with modern LLMs
4. 1-2% SAM capture in Year 1-3 is realistic
5. AI bias concerns can be mitigated with explainable AI

### Alternative Paths Rejected

1. **Global market first** — Rejected due to diverse labor laws, integration complexity, higher CAC
2. **Enterprise focus** — Rejected due to longer sales cycles, complex procurement, entrenched incumbents
3. **Full ATS build** — Rejected due to scope creep, longer time-to-market

---

✅ **Verdict: GO — because the pain is real, budget exists, and competitors validate the market while leaving SMB whitespace. Validate with 15 interviews in 30 days before building.**
